    -- Let's spawn a SM_Plane to be our door, and an empty (SM_None) StaticMesh to be our Hinge.
    -- As the SM_Plane has it's pivot at the center of the mesh, we need to have a Hinge to make it rotate properly.
    -- This is not needed if your Door Mesh already has the pivot at the correct Hinge location.

    -- Spawns the Hinge (which we rotated 90ยบ to stand up)
    local door = StaticMesh(Vector(0, 0, 100), Rotator(0, 0, 90), "NanosWorld::SM_None")

    -- Spawns the Door mesh, scales it to be in the format of a door, and attaches it to the Hinge
    local door_mesh = StaticMesh(Vector(), Rotator(), "NanosWorld::SM_Plane")
    door_mesh:SetScale(Vector(1, 2, 1))

    -- Attaches to the Hinge at a relative location of 50 units (to be at the hinge location)
    door_mesh:AttachTo(door, "", Vector(50, 0, 0))

    -- Spawns our trigger at the center of the Door
    local trigger = Trigger(Vector(0, 0, 100), Rotator(), 150)

    -- Registers the trigger when a Character moves in
    trigger:Subscribe("BeginOverlap", function(trigger, actor)
        if (actor:GetType() ~= "Character") then return end

        -- Plays an opening door animation on the Character
        actor:PlayAnimation("NanosWorld::AM_Mannequin_DoorOpen_01", AnimationSlotType.UpperBody)

        -- Rotates the door -90ยบ smoothly
        door:RotateTo(Rotator(0, -90, 90), 1)
    end)

    -- Registers the trigger when a Character moves out
    trigger:Subscribe("EndOverlap", function(trigger, actor)
        if (actor:GetType() ~= "Character") then return end

        -- Rotates the door back to original position, smoothly
        door:RotateTo(Rotator(0, 0, 90), 1)
    end)
