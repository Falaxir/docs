On this page we will show you how to create a Linux virtual machine instance on Compute Engine using the Google Cloud Console withing the **Free Tier** limit.

.. tip:: The following guide was based and had several excerpts taken from https://linuxhint.com/setup_google_cloud_server.


What Is Google Cloud?
---------------------

Launched in 2008, Google Cloud is a comprehensive cloud computing suite running on the same powerful global infrastructure Google uses for its central products, including Google Search and YouTube.

Google Cloud provides secure storage, powerful compute, and integrated data analytics products that can satisfy the needs of everyone from individual home users to larger enterprises.

Some of the most noteworthy use cases of Google Cloud include web hosting, deployment of globally available apps, fully managed cloud data warehouse, machine learning, shared gaming experiences, and automation of repetitive tasks, just to give a few examples.

With Google Cloud, anyone can easily spin up a virtual machine in seconds and use it as a worry-free alternative to a physical server. Because all resources are virtualized, it’s possible to effortlessly add more processing power or storage on demand, so you always pay only for what you use.

Best of all, all new Google Cloud users receive a $300 credit that can be  used with any Google Cloud service. To be eligible for the bonus credit, you have to be a new Google Cloud customer and set up a billing account by providing your credit card information, which is required to verify that you’re not a bot.


Setting Up a Google Cloud Server from Scratch for nanos world
-------------------------------------------------------------

Google has made it very easy to set a new Google Cloud server from scratch, and the whole process shouldn’t take you more than 15 minutes from start to finish.


Step 1: Sign In to Google Cloud
-------------------------------

At https://console.cloud.google.com, click on **Get started for free** located in the upper-right of the screen:

If you haven’t provided your credit card details to Google before, you will be asked to do so now. Don’t worry: Google won’t start charging you until you spend the $300 bonus, which you can do within a year. Furthermore, you have to manually upgrade to a paid account for Google to start charging you.

Step 2: Create a New Google Cloud Server
----------------------------------------

To create a new VM, select 'Compute Engine' and then 'VM Instances'

If it is not enabled yet, enable it and wait about 1-2 minutes to finish:

After that, you will be able to create a new Instance:

.. image:: https://i.imgur.com/fiF4vLO.png

Give it a **Name** and select under Machine Configuration the Series **N1** and Machine Type *f1-micro* - this part is important as only f1-micro is under Free Tier.
Also it is required that you select one of the following regions to be eligible for Free Tier: **Oregon: us-west1**, **Iowa: us-central1** or **South Carolina: us-east1**.

Under **Boot Disk**, for this guide we recommend selecting **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**:

.. image:: https://i.imgur.com/KEqSGF9.png

Under **Firewall** select to allow **HTTP** and **HTTPS** traffic, as well in **Security** tab add your public **SSH Key** to it, if you don't have a key yet please `create one <https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent>`_. Only with a **SSH Key** you will be able to connect to your instance from your computer.

Once you have everything configured to your liking, click the 'Create' button on the bottom of the page.


Step 3: Use your Google Cloud Server
------------------------------------

.. image:: https://i.imgur.com/ZjjorqI.png

The next step is to connect into your Virtual Machine, for that launch your prompt (shell or cmd) and type:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ssh [YOUR_VM_EXTERNAL_IP]

.. image:: https://i.imgur.com/jgWm847.png

Type **yes** if asked, and you will be in!

Step 4: Installing nanos world server
-------------------------------------

Now you must download nanos world server in your VM.

For that, you can use our public repository in the GitHub to download it with the following two commands:

.. code-block:: console

   $ curl -L https://github.com/nanos-world/nanos-world-server/releases/download/latest/NanosWorldServer -o NanosWorldServer
   $ chmod +x NanosWorldServer

This will download NanosWorldServer executable and set it to be an executable itself. After downloading, you can start your server like:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ./NanosWorldServer

.. image:: https://i.imgur.com/mrh6Nk9.png

And voila! You have a nanos world server running!

Note that your server failed to communicate with the **Master Server**, this is because we didn't forward the correct ports yet in your VM, let's do that in the next step!


Step 5: Forwarding Ports in the Google Cloud
--------------------------------------------

To be able to communicate with Master Server or for other players to be able to connect to your server, you must forward your server ports. By default nanos world use ports 7777 (UDP and TCP).

First go to the left menu bar and select **VPC network** and **Firewall**:

.. image:: https://i.imgur.com/UsvSYHd.png

In that, you will be able to create a new **Firewall Rule**, add the name you want to it, set it to **Ingress**, set source IP: **0.0.0.0/0** and select **Specified protocol and ports**: **tcp: 7777** and **udp: 7777**, and create it.

.. image:: https://i.imgur.com/RAotwW3.png

Now you can restart your server and you will see it will communicate properly with Master Server (no warnings anymore):

And can also find it in the **Find Servers** menu:

Conclusion
----------

In this guide you learnt how easy it is to create a free server for nanos world using Google Cloud! Remember that Google Cloud is a paid service that offers small free tasting services, as nanos world doesn't need that much processing the Free Tier is enough for basic game modes and to play with friends! Pay attention to the Google Cloud contracts and try to learn out more about it so as not to be caught off guard!
