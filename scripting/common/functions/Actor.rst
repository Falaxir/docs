  * - 
    - **Returns**
    - **Name**
    - **Description**

  * - |authority-only-label|
    - 
    - AddImpulse( |br-p| :ref:`Vector` force, |br-p| :term:`boolean` velocity_change = false |br| )
    - Applies a Force in world coordinate on this Actor (the force is applied on Client side, by the (in most of cases) the closest player of this object)

  * - |authority-only-label|
    - 
    - AttachTo( |br-p| Actor other, |br-p| :term:`string` bone_name = "", |br-p| :ref:`Vector` relative_location = Vector(), |br-p| :ref:`Rotator` relative_rotation = Rotator() |br| )
    - Attaches this Actor to any other Actor with a Relative Offset/Rotation

  * - |authority-only-label|
    - 
    - Destroy()
    - Destroys this Actor

  * - |authority-only-label|
    - 
    - Detach()
    - Detaches this Actor from AttachedTo Actor

  * - |authority-only-label|
    - 
    - SetCollision(:term:`CollisionType`)
    - Sets the actor's collision **Collision Types**: *Normal, Static Only, NoCollision*

  * - |authority-only-label|
    - 
    - SetGravityEnabled(:term:`boolean`)
    - Sets the actor's gravity enabled

  * - |authority-only-label|
    - 
    - SetHighlightEnabled( |br-p| :term:`boolean`, |br-p| :term:`number` Index |br| )
    - Sets if this Actors is Highlighting at a specific Index color

  * - |authority-only-label|
    - 
    - SetInitialLocation(:ref:`Vector`)
    - Sets the initial location

  * - |authority-only-label|
    - 
    - SetLocation(:ref:`Vector`)
    - Sets the actor's location in the game world

  * - |server-only-label|
    - 
    - SetNetworkAuthority( |br-p| :ref:`Player` player = nil, |br-p| :term:`number` time_ms = 0 |br| )
    - Sets this actor's new Player network authority. This player will be manually assigned to handle this actor physics and share it's location with other clients. The authority assignment will still be overriden by the game automatically, to avoid that set a big time value so the player can keep longer with the authority and override the natural authority selection.

  * - 
    - 
    - TranslateTo( |br-p| :ref:`Vector` location, |br-p| :term:`number` speed |br| )
    - Smoothly moves this actor to a Location with a certain Speed

  * - 
    - 
    - RotateTo( |br-p| :ref:`Rotator` rotation, |br-p| :term:`number` speed |br| )
